# ImageManipulation
🖼️ Image Augmentation with Keras and Google Colab
This project demonstrates how to upload an image in Google Colab and apply image augmentation techniques using Keras's ImageDataGenerator. This is useful for expanding your image dataset and improving model generalization in deep learning.

📌 What It Does
📤 Uploads an image using Google Colab's file uploader.

🖼️ Loads and resizes the image to (224, 224).

🔁 Applies a series of augmentations, including:

Rotation

Width & height shift

Shear

Zoom

Horizontal flip

Brightness adjustment

📷 Displays the augmented images using matplotlib.
